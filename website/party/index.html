For the New Jersey Democratic Party, the most important political geographical area is the County.
<br>
The County Committee is made of 2 members (one male and one female) for each town precinct. One of its most important responsibility is to weigh in and support the candidates to State, Federal and local races.
<br>
The members of the various municipal committees in a county make up the County Committee. The committee <b>members are elected every 2 years during the Primaries elections</b> (usually in June, not in the November General Election).
<br>
<br>
Each County Committee may have different rules and different level of influence in vetting, encouraging, discouraging, support and funding of candidates.
<br>
While for practical reason some key decisions are taken by the Committee chair (both at county and municipal level), every committee is eventually ran by the committee members.
<br>
The Party committees are organized by their bylaws which should be public.
<br>
In New Jersey, most county committees have the mechanism of the "party line" which in principle is like a strong endorsement but in practice it has a stronger effect that every resident should know and the registered Democratic voters have the choice to influence. NJ Salem County Democratic Committee is one with more democratic rules: No Party Line and Secret Vote to elect officials.
<br>
<br>
The best way to influence the party processes, structure, organization and outcomes is to be part of your local municipal committee (which means also be part of the county committee).
<br>
Any registered democratic voter can run to represent their voting precinct (your town, ward, district). 
It is best to discuss a membership with your committee chairperson. To run for committee member the 2019 deadline is April 1st to file the petition with 20 signatures. This is an example of <a target="new" href="https://sussexcountyclerk.org/forms/PRIMARY-PETITION-FOR-MEMBER-OF-COUNTY-COMMITTEE.pdf">petition</a>.

<a href="">Here<a/> you can find a couple of slides with some graphical details on NJ most common local party structure.
<br>
<br>
If you are interested in learning more about the New Jersey "Party Line" process you can read a few articles on the <a target="new" href="https://www.ggcnj.org/news/">Good Government Coalition NJ</a> as well as follow some <a target="new" href="https://www.ggcnj.org/committeetraining/">presentations</a>.
