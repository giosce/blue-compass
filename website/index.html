<center><H2>Welcome to Blue Compass website</H2></center>

<br>
<b>Have you ever found yourself wondering about past and future New Jersey elections?</b>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img/rotating-compass.gif" width="160" height="160">
<br>
<br>
Our Democracy is only as good as we voters and activists are informed of who has governed, who is running, how our districts have voted, 
how many voters there are in a district and so on.
<br>
Thus, being able to navigate within the vaste realm of electoral data, being able to analyze and visualize the available data 
is very important for voters, activists and candidates.
<br>
<br>
Blue Compass website provides aggregation, drill-down analysis and visualization of a few past elections in selected NJ districts, 
counties, towns and precinct.
<br>
All the data throught this website comes from public data either from the NJ State or County Elections offices.
<br>
<br>
Our initial focus has been on <a href="nj7/district_info.html">NJ07 2018 Congressional Elections</a> and then we worked on a few 
NJ Legislative Districts to support the <a href="njcongress.html">2019 NJ Assembly Elections<a/> 
as well as other <a href="njlocal.html">local elections</a>.
<br>
We also collected <a href="memories">many pictures</a> of the political activities that fueled the NJ 2018 Blue Wave!
<br>
<br>
<b>After we focused on the important <a href="2020">2020 Federal elections</a> and the <a href="2021">2021 NJ elections</a> 
now we are focusing on the <a href="2022">2022 Federal elections.</a></b>
<br>
<br>
Most people know that because the absurd Presidential Election mechanism of the
Electoral College (all except four states award all their Electoral Colleges to the party that win even by one vote), the 14 New Jersey Electoral
Colleges will very very likely go all to the Democratic Presidential candidate.
<br>
<br>
Thus, BlueCompass will not cover the Presidential election, there is anyway more than enough work to follow and inform about the New Jersey other elections.
<br>
<br>
In 2020 NJ will elect 12 Representatives and one Senator to send to the Federal Congress.
Plus most of the 21 NJ Counties are electing a few Freeholders and some are electing Clerks and Sheriffs.
<br>
<br>
Some NJ Counties are also electing the members of the Democratic Party County Committees and BlueCompass considers 
these elections important as one of the direct democracy pillar.
<br>
<br>
BlueCompass also advocates for fairer Democratic Party primary elections where ballot access is encouraged, not hindered and where the party
(and County Clerks) don't use the misleading ballor design of "the line".
<br>
<!--
<br>
We also published a quick reference sheet to help activists with arguments pro Democratic candidates and against the WH occupant.
<br>
<br>
This <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSUAwg86APUDlr2GAkm3oSaxP-Z5fz-1zR_LowHjQVlNX8ydVfBLHEhKPZO8NOvq-Ed4BMDSTOJcbE9/pub">reference sheet</a> has a section with Tom Malinowski (NJ07 Democratic candidate) position on key topics (information compiled by us, not provided by the candidate).
<br>
-->
<br>
We are very open to assist with more details as well as other districts nationwide.
<BR>
With your interest and help we believe we can do some part in improving American democracy.
