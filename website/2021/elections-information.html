<a name="vbm"><b>Vote By Mail</b></a>
<br>
There is no need of a reason to request a "Vote By Mail" (VBM) ballot. Although many people like the "emotion" to enter the poll, VBM has the
great benefit to allow you to vote in span of several weeks (usually 45 days) before election day. You don't need to miss a working day or worry about
a slow commute or other unforseable delays.
<br>
Every county resident qualified and registered voter can request to receive a "Vote By Mail" ballot up to 7 days before election day sending the request application to the County Clerk's Office (see below for offices).
Some county office accept VBM request via phone too.
<br>
The voter may also apply in person to the Clerk's office, or by authorized messenger, on any day up to 3:00 P.M. the day before an election.
<br>
Any voter may complete the bottom portion of the application and designate a messenger. A messenger may bring a Mail-In Ballot Application completed by the voter to the County Clerkâ€™s office and pick up a Mail-In Ballot for that voter. The messenger will need to sign the application in front of the County Clerk or designee and show photo ID in order to pick up the ballot. The messenger must deliver the Mail-In Ballot directly to the voter.
<br>
The County Clerk cannot accept faxed or e-mailed copies of the Vote by Mail Application (unless you are an overseas voter, see below), since an original signature is required.
<br>

<br>
Your ballot will be mailed on or after the 45th day prior to Election Day. It contains all the instructions to complete and deliver it.
<br>
If you have applied for an Mail-in Ballot and have decided to instead vote at the polls, you may be able to vote by provisional ballot.
<br>
Your sealed Mail-In Ballot must be received by the County Board of Elections before the close of polls on Election Day.
<br>
<br>
Vote by Mail is also available for "Service Members" and overseas citizens.
<br>
You may apply for a Mail-In Ballot if you are New Jersey resident who is a member of the Uniformed Services, Merchant Marine, Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
"Uniformed Services" include members of the United States Armed Forces (Navy, Army, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard). Family members of a military voter are also entitled to vote by mail.
<br>
If you are a Military voter currently residing within the United States, please complete a Mail-In Ballot Application and mark the appropriate choice in the Special Status box on the application. 
<br>
If you are a Military voter currently residing outside the United States or a US citizens leaving abroad, please complete the <a target="w2" href="https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Forms/fpca.pdf">Federal Post Card Application</a> (FPCA) to receive your Mail-In Ballot. The FPCA acts as both a registration and absentee ballot request form.

<a name="affiliation"><b>Change Party Affiliation</b></a>
<br>
This is really only relevant to regard to vote in the Primary Elections (you can vote only for your party candidates). 
For General Elections you party affiliation doesn't have any relevance.
<br>
Party affiliation at any time is however interesting for speculations on voter turnout and most likely voting choices.
<br>
<br>
A registered voter currently affiliated with a political party who wishes to change their party affiliation must file a Political Party Affiliation Declaration Form 55 days before a Primary Election.
<br>
<br>
A registered voter currently not affiliated with a political party may declare their party affiliation up to and including Primary Election day.
<br>
You can print and complete the Political Party Affiliation Declaration Form and mail or deliver to the Commissioner of Registration in your county or you can also file it with your municipal clerk. These forms are also available at your local Commissioner of Registration Office.
<br>
<br>
The Commissioner of Registration cannot accept faxed copies or an electronic transmission of Party Affiliation Declaration Forms, since an original signature is required.
